BattleClock - Controls flow of time during battle.

// BattleClock uses deltaTime to simulate battle time passing. 
// Multiply deltaTime by (2? 5? some multiple), then add it to everyone's elapsedTime. 
// If unit's elapsedTime > unit's attackTime, subtract attackTime from elapsedTime, and add unit to readyToAct queue (priority queue? Probably. The larger the elapsedTime of the queued units, the "sooner" they would have acted, so they should go first. If theres's a tie, the unit with higher haste goes first. If still a tie, player goes before enemy. If still a tie, first queued goes first). 
// Only deal with deltaTime if readyToAct queue is empty? 
// What if Effect would have ticked within deltaTime, between two units in queue? 
// Perhaps a ScheduledUpdate interface for the priority queue, which can handle both units and effects? 
// Keeping deltaTime mult lower will help alleviate the chances of this happening (hopefully?), but will also slow the overall flow of battle time, although this shouldn't be a big problem, if attack times stay low. 

Wait, better idea (? maybe?). If (and only if), readyToAct queue is empty (no units scheduled to act, and no Effects scheduled to tick), sort all ScheduledUpdate entities by attackTime - elapsedTime, find the lowest (least time remaining before action taken), schedule them to act (resolving multiple actors as above), and subtract the elapsed time (equal to the time required for the scheduled actor to get from elapsedTime to attackTime) from all actors. 
So:

minTime = MAX_TIME
actorIDs = []
for actor in actors:
    actionTime = actor.attackTime - (elapsedTime % actor.attackTime)
    assert(actionTime >= 0) // if less than 0, then we're not properly updating all actor times each loop
    if actionTime == minTime:
        actorIDs.add(actor.ID)
    else if actionTime < minTime:
        minTime = actionTime
        actorIDs.clear()
        actorIDs.add(actor.ID)

elapsedTime += minTime
for id in actorIDs:
    readyToAct.add(getActor(id))



Each unit has a set of Abilities.

Abilities can be either Targeted or NonTargeted.

Abilities can cause immediate damage/healing, or apply Effects.

Should one-time instant attacks be another type of Effect? Have a type of effect that is analyzed on BattleClock tick (HOT/DOT), and another type analyzed on attack (for attacker and target)?

Effects can be Buffs, Debuffs, HealOverTime, or DamageOverTime,

Buffs and Debuffs can be timed (for the next 20 seconds), or value-based (for the next three attacks, for the next 200 damage taken, until the next critical attack, etc.)

These can include things like haste/slow, damage dealt/taken increased/decreased, vulnerability/resistance to damage/healing/Effects, stuns, slows, crit, etc.

HealOverTime and DamageOverTime have a max duration (possibly affected by gear/stats/skills), a tickTime (shortened by haste/gear/skills), a damage/healing min and max (actual value chosen at random between min and max each tick), an optional weight (to influence the damage/healing bell curve towards max or min, will default to no-influence value).

Different types of elemental damage: 
    Holy: heals for a percentage of damage dealt.
    Fire: Increases target damage taken for a short time after attack
    Cold: Decreases target haste for a short time after attack
    Nature: Reduces target ability to dodge/parry for a time.
    Arcane: Reduces target crit chance and damage for a time
    Necrosis: Reduces target life regen and healing effects for a short time after attack

Equipment cannot be changed after start of battle, so gear stat contributions can be precalculated. However, buffs/spells/potions/effects can alter base stats (or should this not be allowed?), so is precalc useful at all?

Stats:

Brawn   (strength): Most melee damage       / parry
Brains (intellect): Magic damage            / crit chance
Finesse  (agility): Dagger/bow/gun damage   / dodge
Faith     (spirit): Resource recovery       / haste
Vitality (stamina): Health                  / resistance
Vigor     (energy): Resource capacity       / crit damage

Damage types:
    Physical
    Magic:
        Holy
        Fire
        Cold
        Nature
        Arcane
        Necrosis
