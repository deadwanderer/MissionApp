Creating tension in choices helps create unique playthroughs and expands player choice/influence on game.
Classes should offer unique feels to play.
    - Heavy, soldier-type attacks slower, much less (or no) avoidance, but large absorbs, even invuln for a time.
        Sword-n-board/guardian archetype emphasizes survivability, at a bit of damage tradeoff. The "safe" choice.
        Two-hander/reaver archetype emphasizes risk/reward. Damage increases as health decreases. The "risky" choice.
        - Favors heavy armor and weapons, shields, two-handers
        - Abilities around mitigation, reducing heavy armor penalties, brute force
    - Light, rogue-type attacks quickly, at most mid-mitigation, much more avoidance
        Rogue archetype emphasizes dodging around enemy attacks and finding weak points. The "risky" choice.
        Ranger archetype emphasizes ranged combat and pet/trap damage. The "safe" choice.
        - Favors light to medium armor, bows, guns, daggers, 1-hand weapons, spears
        - Abilities around avoidance, attack speed, critical damage, finesse
    - Mage-type attacks from "range" (how to model?), avoids melee range altogether
        Elementalist archetype emphasizes magical damage to destroy foes. The "safe" choice.
        Bloodmage archetype emphasizes risk/reward, spending health to restore mana and deal damage. "Risky" choice.
        Loremaster archetype emphasizes healing and buffs/debuffs, strong survivability at some damage cost. "Safe" choice.
        Illusionist archetype emphasizes illusory weapons and pets, as well as enemy debuffs. "Risky" choice.
